#Describing the command line

> Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line is a way of telling a computer what to do, by using only a keyboard. You can do all the same things that you can do with a mouse on your computer - except instead of using the mouse to tell the computer what to do, you type instructions to the computer.

##Some terminal commands

* `pwd` this will tell you which folder you are currently in.
* `cd` stands for 'change directory'. Use this instruction (AKA command) to go to a different folder.
* `cd ..` takes you back one folder, similar to clicking the back button.  
* `ls` Typing this command with tell you what files are inside a folder.
* `cp` will let you copy a file
* `mv` move a file
* `rm` stands for 'remove' - delete a file
* `touch` make a new file
* `more` see the contents of a file
* `head` see the contents of a file (only the first 10 lines)
